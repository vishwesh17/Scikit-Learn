# Scikit-Learn
The file contains playing around scikit-learn library. Trying different Machine Learning models and tuning of hyperparameters. The file might take some time to load in jupyter notebook. The file contains following contents:
* An end-to-end Scikit-Learn workflow,
* Getting the data ready
* Choose the right estimator/algorithm for our problems
* Fit the model/algorithm and use it to make predictions on our data
* Evaluating a model
* Improve a model
* Save and load a trained model
* Putting it all together!
